# Market-Research-for-Automated-Cafe

In this project, I analyzed open source data on various hospitality establishments in LA to find any insights that might be helpful for investors interested in opening automated cafes.

Based on expected characteristics of an automated cafe, I primarily focused on fast food chains, highlighting commonalities with location and seating capacity.

This repository includes the Jupyter Notebook file, along with the csv dataset and a pdf of the visual presentation of the results.
